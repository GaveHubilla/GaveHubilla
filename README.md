About Me
I'm Gave Francis Hubilla, a 29-year-old who recently made the exciting move to Abu Dhabi. With a background as a sushi chef at the Marriott, I've developed a keen eye for detail and a passion for creating exquisite experiences. However, my journey has taken a turn towards the digital world.

I've been diving into the realm of web development, and it's been a thrilling ride so far. I've been enrolled in Angela Yu's challenging yet incredibly rewarding Udemy course, where I've discovered that the complexities of coding can be as captivating as the art of sushi-making.

In addition to Angela's course, I've been a dedicated follower of YouTube channels like Web Dev Tutorials and Programming with Mosh. These platforms have become my digital mentors, guiding me through coding projects that challenge and inspire me. As I navigate this delicious fusion of my culinary background and newfound web development skills, I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
